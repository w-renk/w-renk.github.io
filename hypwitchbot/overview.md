# HypWitchBot

HypWitchBot lives in the chat for HyperionWitch's Twitch stream. It responds to certain words said in chat and provides a fun little game for viewers to play with certain perks that can be purchased with channel points (not yet implemented).

## Non-Exhaustive List of Commands

### !help
Responds with a short description and a url to this page.

### !hunt
Prints a fun message in chat.

#### **The following commands have not been implemented yet**

### !delete
HypWitchBot will delete your game progress. It will ask you if you are sure you want to proceed and give you a message you will need to respond with. Your progress can not be restored and your channel points can not be refunded. If you want to start playing again, you will need to spend channel points to purchase a new pet. 

### !pets
HypWitchBot will respond with a list of pets you own.

### !select \<name\>
Switches your active pet to the specified one.

### !battle or !fight
Your active pet fights a random battle to win prizes

### !rename \<old-name\> \<new-name\>
Renames your pet. You can't have multiple pets with the same name. Please don't name your pet something offensive or inconsiderate. Will doesn't want to have to ban people for silly reasons like that. Names can only be a single word, but they can include numbers, hyphens, underscores and probably most other punctuation except for backticks (`) and double quotes/inch marks (").

## The Game

**None of this has actually been implemented yet. This is only a tentative overview.**

Any viewer can play, there is nothing you need to do to start playing beyond purchasing a pet with channel points. If you haven't yet purchased a pet, 

Once you purchase a new pet, HypWitchBot will give you a random one and tell you its name. If you would like to rename it, just type `!rename <old-name> <new-name>` in chat.
